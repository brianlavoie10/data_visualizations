# User research 

## Target audience
I am generally targetting folks that were at or *would have wanted to be at* The Occupy Protests in 2011, or anyone who would have wanted to be there but was too young to go. So target audience is likely under 50, politically liberal, and anxious about wealth inequality in the world.

I luckily live with a someone in my target audience, and I can also find a couple of students in our class who also fit the bill.

## Interview findings
Interview Findings

Participant 1

On research questions: Suggested looking at how wealth inequality connects to everyday costs like housing, healthcare, and education — “what’s the lived impact of inequality?”

On alternate visuals: Thought infographics or visual timelines could make the story feel less abstract, for example showing the cost of rent or tuition then vs. now compared to income growth.

quote: “It’d be interesting to see how inequality shows up in things people actually buy, not just in lines on a chart.”

Participant 2 

On research questions: Wanted to see more about how inequality affects political power, such as campaign contributions or lobbying.

On alternate visuals: Suggested storytelling formats like photo essays or short video clips from the Occupy protests, alongside the data, to connect numbers to emotions.

quote: “The charts tell me the data, but images from the protests would remind me this was a movement, not just a statistic”


# Identified changes for Part III
I am going to look into how else I can visualize the wealth disparity other than line charts and a table.
