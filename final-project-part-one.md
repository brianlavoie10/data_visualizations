# Outline
I will tell the story of stock market growth concentration over the last 8 years. I am looking to break the prevailing knowledge that all stocks are constantly increasing in value all of the time. In fact, most of the growth in the stock market over the last year can be contributed to the Information Technology and Communications sector. (Graphs 1, 2 and 3). Moreover, we could go even further and see that a large portion of the growth within these sectors are concentrated within a group of stocks dubbed 'The Magnificent 7' (Graph 4). While these companies change from time to time based on market captialization, they still make up for a large part of stock growth over the last decade.

I can end by briefly discussing the second wave of this concentration lead by investment in AI - NVIDIA alone has accounted for 22% of all stock market growth in the last year! (I didn't sketch this but maybe a bar chart of % growth contributed by a handful of large companies - NVIDIA will be on head and shoulders above the rest). 

End with a few headlines about how news outlets are catching on to this concentration and think of a call to action from there. I think getting the information out is an act of responsible citizenry in itself.

# The data
Financial data is everywhere... and nowhere!!! While it is plastered on every TV screen from Fox Business to CNN (remember those ticker tapes at the bottom of the news?), it is very difficult to find a source that easily conglomerates this free data into easily downloadable csv's! However, I have found a couple of spreadsheets with market capitalization for each sector of the S&P 500, and longitudinal data on specific company marketcaps are easy to find through a Google Search.


Macro Trends historic S&P evaluation Data - [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history/](https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data) - This source gives overall market cap of the S&P 500 going back to 1930

Another fun thing I learned is that Microsoft Excel pulls market data for individual companies with the "STOCKHISTORY" function. This method will also be uesd for individual company price growth.




# Method and medium
I am a huge fan of Shorthand! I plan on making a story there with Tableau Public data visuals embedded as we go!
