# Outline
I will tell the story of stock market growth concentration over the last 8 years. I am looking to break the prevailing knowledge that all stocks are constantly increasing in value all of the time. In fact, most of the growth in the stock market over the last year can be contributed to the Information Technology and Communications sector. (Graphs 1, 2 and 3). Moreover, we could go even further and see that a large portion of the growth within these sectors are concentrated within a group of stocks dubbed 'The Magnificent 7' (Graph 4). While these companies change from time to time based on market captialization, they still make up for a large part of stock growth over the last decade.

I can end by briefly discussing the second wave of this concentration lead by investment in AI - NVIDIA alone has accounted for 22% of all stock market growth in the last year! (I didn't sketch this but maybe a bar chart of % growth contributed by a handful of large companies - NVIDIA will be on head and shoulders above the rest). 

End with a few headlines about how news outlets are catching on to this concentration and think of a call to action from there. I think getting the information out is an act of responsible citizenry in itself.
